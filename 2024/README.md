# Bracketeering 2023

<!--

TODO : Darren : document something idk

I want to treat 2022 as a standalone project. I don't want to share the documentation between 2021 and 2022, because things will likely change.

This might have been easier IF I HAD ALREADY DOCUMENTED THE 2021 PROJECT BUT OF COURSE I DIDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT SORT OF SOFTWARE ENGINEER DOCUMENTS THEIR CODE!?!??!
